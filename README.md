# LÖVR Snippets

This repo contains (mainly) small examples for LÖVR. Perhaps things not obvious from the official documentation.

For now we have the following examples.

## Crossfade

Show a crossfade between 2 textures.

## Texture Fill

Make a texture fill the full screen.

## Thread Communications

Communicate from main thread to secondary thread and vice versa.

## Load BSP

Load a Quake 1 BSP file.
